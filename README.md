# SDL2-Project

This is my SDL2 Playground, where I experiment with different features and mechanics for a game. At the moment, there isn't a set game in mind, but the goal is to build something exciting over time!

## Features
- SDL2 game engine experimentation
- Future plans for more features and mechanics

## Installation
Clone the repository and set up with your preferred C++ development environment. Make sure you have SDL2 installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RealityHertz/SDL2-Project.git
